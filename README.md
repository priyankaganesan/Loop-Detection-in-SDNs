#README: Detecting Loops in SDNs: Static Data Plane Verification

---
###1. Introduction:
It aims to find loops in a test network, using static data plane verification. In this process, the networks flow table dumps are analyzed in order to create forwarding graphs. This is shown in the figure below[1].

These graphs are partitioned based on the destination IP prefix, as seen[1].

The partitioned graphs are processed using Tarjan's algorithm for strongly connected components, in order to detect loops[1].

The implementation of this project is based on the paper ["Libra: Divide and Conquer to Verify Forwarding Tables in Huge Networks"](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi14/technical-sessions/presentation/zeng).

###3. Setup

	i. Within the VM, place the following project files in the '~pyretic/pyretic/examples' directory:
		* insertLoop.py
		* insertNoLoop.py
		* detect_loop.py
		* LibraTopo.py

	ii. In one terminal window, move to the directory '~/pyretic'. At the prompt, start the controller by typing:
		'pyretic.py -m p0 pyretic.examples.insertNoLoop'

	iii. In a second terminal window, move to '~/pyretic/pyretic/examples' and start the LibraTopo topology using the following command:
		'sudo mn --custom ~pyretic/pyretic/examples/LibraTopo.py --topo libra_topo --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote'

	iv. In a third terminal window move to '~/pyretic/pyretic/examples' and start the loop detection program:
		'python detect_loop.py'

	v. Since we have used a controller which will not input loops in the topology, we will get the following messages:
		>Testing topology for destination IP 10.0.0.1
		>No loop detected!
		>Testing topology for destination IP 10.0.0.2
		>No loop detected!

	vi. Kill the processes in the current windows. Repeat steps (ii)-(iv) using the 'insertLoop' controller. In this case, the output will be:
		>Testing topology for destination IP 10.0.0.1
		>Loop detected between the switches (4,3,1)
		>Testing topology for destination IP 10.0.0.2
		>No loop detected!

	vii. The flow dumps will be generated in the files s1.txt, s2.txt, s3.txt, s4.txt
